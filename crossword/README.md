# Crossword in React

This is an implementation of the react crossword in https://github.com/JaredReisinger/react-crossword.

Pretty much everything is there.

# Usage

Feel free to clone this repo and use it as a backup while going through the tutorial, or expand it to build an even better Wordle clone.

To start the project run `yarn` and `yarn dev` in your repo folder.

This is built using Vite in the parent project, which is a really weird situation but that's where we are now.
