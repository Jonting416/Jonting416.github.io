# Crossword in React

This is a page which embeds a crossword made in [crosshare](https://crosshare.org)

iFrame Embedding is great!

# Usage

Feel free to clone this repo and use it as a backup while going through the tutorial, or expand it to build an even better Wordle clone.

To start the project run `yarn` and `yarn dev` in your repo folder.

This is built using Vite in the parent project, which is a really weird situation but that's where we are now.
